"""Runs the three bare-LLM tests (hotspots, ownership, dead-code) against a
given model - a single simple_completion() call per test, no tools, no
multi-turn refinement. This is what produced
results/det_vs_llm_model_outputs.md.

Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in the environment and `aletheore` installed
(`pip install aletheore` - the adapter is a thin OpenAI-compatible wrapper,
reused here rather than duplicated).

Usage: python scripts/det_vs_llm_run_bare_llm.py <model-name>
